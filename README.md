# Hearthstone-Pack-and-Collection-Sim
A JavaScript tool to simulate mass pack openings in Hearthstone and the resulting collection. Options for including/excluding core set cards. Additionally, cards are "bought" in the same quantities as they are available in game, so that the simulator can display both the gold value and actual USD value of your collection.
